# flask-beaver
Flask-Beaver is an integration of Flask-AppBuilder that allows for models and views to be configured entirely from YAML Based Blueprint Documents.  The design intent for accomplish this using a minimal number of python files overlaid ontop of the standard Flask-AppBuilder application.  Not sure if this will be possible with a traditional addon structure for flask.
